# LearnSTL

### This is my programs while learning the STL library in C++ and its containers for faster implementation of the data structures. It will also shorten the code. It will be best suitable for the competive programming.

### List of the programs are:
#### 1. Using pairs in STL
#### 2. Using tuples in STL
#### 3. Using arrays in STL
#### 4. Implementing vector in STL
#### 5. Use vector in STL to make a program for insertion(begning, middle, end) and deletion(begning, middle, end).
#### 6. Use List in STL to make a program for insertion(begning, middle, end), deletion(begning, middle, end), reverse a list and sort(ascending and descending).
#### 7. Implementing map in STL
